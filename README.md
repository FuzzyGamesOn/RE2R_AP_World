## Anything else I should know?
### Feedback or Questions
If you have feedback or questions about the rando, join the [AP After Dark Discord](https://discord.gg/Sbhy4ykUKn) and visit our [game channel](https://discord.com/channels/1085716850370957462/1259648589039272028) there! You can also submit Issues here on GitHub, but they will typically get a slower response than the Discord channel.

### Is this open world?
No, the story and access progression is very similar to the vanilla game, but item randomization does change how you route through the areas after they are unlocked.

### Why does Clock Tower / Roof ladder / Mr. X not work while I'm in RPD 1?
These are all activated by a trigger after leaving RPD 1 and fighting the G1 boss. So they won't be active when you first arrive at RPD.
